# dubins car

##### This repository defines a Dubin's Car and moves it through teleoperation or through a waypoint (controlled by the user). In this repository "main_teleop.cpp" allows for teleoperation of the Dubin's car and "main.cpp" uses a waypoint (controlled by the user) to command car movement. Both scripts visual the car movement in matplotlib through python bindings. Additionally, there are other scripts to test the ability to use matplotlib and Eigen (for matrix multiplication).  

## Teleoperated Dubin's Car
##### You can teleoperate the Dubin's Car through "main_teleop.cpp". The controls of this script can be seen below:
##### - "w" = speed up
##### - "s" = stop vehicle movement
##### - "x" = reverse
##### - "a" = turn left
##### - "d" = turn right
##### - "e" = stop turning
##### - "q" = quit program
