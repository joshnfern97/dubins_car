# dubins car

##### This repository defines a Dubin's Car and moves it through teleoperation or through a waypoint (controlled by the user). In this repository "main_teleop.cpp" allows for teleoperation of the Dubin's car and "main.cpp" uses a waypoint (controlled by the user) to command car movement. Both scripts visual the car movement in matplotlib through python bindings. Additionally, there are other scripts to test the ability to use matplotlib and Eigen (for matrix multiplication).
